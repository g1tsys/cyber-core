### A simple roadmap created by AI to guide me through learning cyber security related content

Learning cybersecrurity effectively requires a structrure approach, combing foundational knowledge hands-on practice, and continuouslearning. Below is a step-by-step roadmap to guide you from beginner to advanced levels.


## Phase 1: Build a Strong Foundation 

1. Learn Basic IT & Networking 

Understand how computers operating systems (Windows, Linux), nad networks work. 

Key topics:
  - TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, VPNs, Firewalls 
  - OSI Model, Subnetting, Routing & Switching 


Resources 
  - Computer Networking Basics (YouTube: NetworkChuck) 
  Book: "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" (Kurose & Ross)


Master Operating Systems 

Learn LInux (Kali Linux, Ubuntu) and Windows command line.

Key skills:
  - Bash Scripting, file permissions, process management

**Resources** Linux for Hachers (Youtube: The Cyber Mentor)
TryHackMe's Linux Fundamentals


3. Learn Programming & Scripting

Essential langauges:
  Python: (for automation, exploits, tools)
  Bash (Linux scripting)
  PowerSHell (Windows automation)


Resources
  Automate the Boring Stuff with Python 
  Learn PowerShell (Microsoft Docs)

## Phase 2: Core Cybersecurity Concepts 

4. Understand Cybersecurity fundamentals

Key areas: 

CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
Threat modeling, Risk manangement 
Security policies & compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

Resources:

Cybersecurity Essentials (Coursera)

Book:"Cybersecurity for Dummies" (Steinberg)

5. Learn ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing

Study common attacks vectors:

- Phishing, SQLi, XSS, CSRF, MITM, DoS

Tools:

NMAP, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Wireshark 

Resources:

TryHackME (Beginner-friendly)
Hack THe Box
(Intermediate/Advanced)
Book:"The Web Application Hacker's Handbook" (Dafydd Stuttard)

6. Defensive Security (Blue Team)

Learn:
  SIEM (Splunk, ELK Stack)
  IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata)
  Endpoint security (EDR, Antivirus)
Resources:
  Blue Team Labs Online
  Security Blue Team

## Phase 3: Specialization & Advanced Topics 

Choose a Specialization 

- Penetration Testing / Red Teaming (Offensive Security)
- SOC Analyst / Incident Response (Blue Team)
- Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering
- Cloud Security (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- IoT / Mobile Security

8. Get Certified (Optional but Recommended)

Beginner:

CompTIA Security+
eLearning Junior Penetration Tester (eIPT)

Intermediate:

Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)

Advanced:

CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)
SANS GIAC Certifications (GCIH, GPEN)

## Phase 4: Continuous Learnign & Practice 

Stay Updated:

Follow Security news (Krebs on Security, The Hacker News)
Join communities (Reddit r/cybersecurity, Discord groups)

**Participate in CTFs & Bug Bounties:**

CTFTime
Bugcrowd, HackerOne

Build a Home Lab:

Use VirtualBox/VMware to simulate attacks & defenses.


Final Tips:

âœ… Hands-on practice is key â€“ Use platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and VulnHub.

âœ… Networking matters â€“ Engage in cybersecurity communities.

âœ… Stay curious & ethical â€“ Never practice on systems without permission.
