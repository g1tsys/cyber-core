When We Use An Application 

- Application we use will have their data packaged and taggde with instructions 
- Those instructions are interpreted by the recipient's application and eventually displayed 
- The application layer acts as an interface between your computer and the programs on it and the netowrk you want to communicate on 
- Lots and lots of instructions at the application layer


Different Types of Application Protocols 

- File Transfer 
- Application Protocols
- Network Management 
- Domain Name Management 
- Browser 


Different Types of Application Protocols 

- Email - File Transfer - Network Management - Remote Logon - Browser

Example: A Website Address

- Using a web browser allows a user to receive or transmit information in a visual manner
- How does the computer know where to go in order to request information?
- A computer needs to translate a human friendly term, with something it understands

DNS: The Phonebook of The Internet

- A set of lists that pairs a name like google.com, with a value computer understands
- The computer retrieves an Internet Protocol (IP) address so humans don't have to memorize it.
- So to find google.com your computer first needs to find the right telephone book and entry and only then can it be returned the right IP address for google.com
- Four Components: local DNS server, Root DNS server, TLD DNS server, Authoritative DNS server
- When you register a domain name, the "name space" is managed by an organization 
- Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) 
- Root Zones are geographically distributed 
- The locations of the TLD DNS servers are managed by those organizations 

Why does this matter?

- Vulnerabilities exist in several of these protocols 
- Hackers use those vulnerabilities to gain access or to achieve an effect
- Software developers who are not careful in the design of their software mgith introduce vectors of attack 
- Network administrators who leave vulnerabilities in their systems might introduce attack vectors 

Take Away

- Information that translates how programs on a computer must interact with the network in which data will traverse is done at the application layer. 
- Translating human domain names into computer friendly IP addresses into computer friendly IP addresses is done by the DNS protocol
