#### Cybersecurity for Everyone 

- Demystifying the cybersecurity problem; Topic 1: Defining Cyber, Security, and Cybersecurity Policy 
- "U.S. Hit by 77,000 Cyber Attacks 2015 - a 10 Percent Jump" - Newsweek 
- "7 Billon Records in first 3 quarters [of 2017]" - Online Trust Alliance 
- "List of data breaches and cyber attacks in 2016 - 3.1 billon records leaked" - IT Governance 
- "Shipping company Maersk says June cyberattack could cost up to $300M" - CNBC

#### What do we need to be concerned about? 

Different Perspectives Different Questions 
Individuals
- What local, state, or federal laws should be written to protect me?
- How do cyber attacks impact my privacy?
- What type of activity does it cover?


Business 
- What is the liability for businesses if they experience an attack? 
- Can businesses "hack back" to retaliate against hackers?
- Should businesses be compelled to turn over source code of products to foreign governments to assess vulnerability? 

Nation State 
- Is a cyber attack from one country to another an act of war? 
- Is there a difference between espionage and disruptive attacks?
- Should common agreements between nations be used to create "norms" of behaviors? How do you enforce them? 
- How should countries cooperate (or not) to assist in criminal investigations? 
- How do I manage threats to my critical infrastructure? 

From the perspective of a policy maker
- The goal of the policy maker is to take advantage of the beneficial aspects of technology while minimizing the security risks 

Broad Areas of Concern 

- Confidentiality, integrity, accessibility, of government networks 
- We need to understand the impact to important civil services 
- National and International Concerns 

Examples of Cyber Policy 
Laws 
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 
- Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

Executive Orders or Policy Directives 
- PPD-41: United States Cyber Coordination 
- PPD-21: Critical Infrastructure Designation 

Regulations 
- National do not call registry 

Frameworks
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework 
- ODNI Cybersecurity Framework

President Speeches 
- "that's why I've said that protecting our digital infrastructure is a national security priority and economic priority." President Obama 2015


#### The Threat Landscape
Hackers 
- James Clapper, Directer of National Intelligence (2015)
- Threats to the US national and economic security are increasing in size, scale, and severity of impact
    - Disruptive and Exploitive attacks 
    - Defacementm, PoS, Ransomeware, DDoS, SCADA, etc

- Range of actors, mthods of attack, targets, and victims are also expanding
    - commercial, personal, government, infrastructure
    - hacktivists, APTs, criminals, and hobbyists 

- Probably no Cyber Armageddon, more targeted attacks 
    - "...Several nations -- including Iran and North Korean have undertaken offensive cyber operations against private sector targets to support their economic and foreign policy objectives..."

- Tacktics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP)

    - Phisphing
    - Ransomeware 
    - Distributed Denial of Service -
    - Privilege Escalation
    - Infrastructure
    - Virus
    - Trojan
    - Malware-less Attacks
      (Powershell, Batch Scripting, etc)
    - ICS Attacks 
Effects 
Diverse methods for remote attack or supply chain compromise mean that large protions of the IT infrastructure supporting criticle elements of our modern society remain at risk
    - Transportation (SF Muni Attack)
    - Electrical Grid (Ukraine Power Attack)
    - Industrial Attacks (German Steel Mill)

Costs can be measured in a variety of ways 
    - OPM (Entirety of SSBI Database)
    - Yahoo (3 Billon Logins)
    - Home Depot (56 millon credit cards)
    - Ukraine Power Grid (80,000 people without electricity)

Attack Surface 

Business is Global and Complex 
    - IT networks are scaled and distributed 
    - Mix of business and personal devices 
    - Uncertainty around which systems support business functions
    - Are you defenses optimized to defend from the threats you are facing? 

Attributing Attacks is Difficult

- Attachers try to hide 
    - Proxy infrastructure 
    - Cutout identities 
    - Diffusion of code 

- Law Enforecement and Private Security Play Detective 
    - Infrastructure 
    - Roort kits
    - Malware 

Wide range of targets 

- Should the government provide greater regulatory oversight on specific industry sectors? 
- Should some companies be compelled to share their netowkr data with the government? 

Wide range of actors

- What type of penalties should we enact for hobbyist, criminals, or nation state actors? 
- What is the international standard required to attribute an attack to a country? 

Wide range of vectors 

- Should the government be required to disclose technocial vulnerabilities to the private sector? 
- Should the government promote backdoors into encrypted systems? 

Diverse attack surface 
- Should companies use cloud infrastructure? 
- Should governments requier specific companies to understand and vet their suppliers? 

Complex effects 
- Are all cyber attacks a concern?
- How do we determine what effects are a private problem versus a public concern?
