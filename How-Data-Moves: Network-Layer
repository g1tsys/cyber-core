OSI Model: Instruction for Each Layer


How does data route across networks?

- I want to move my data from my location to somewhere around the world 
- Problem: There are a lot of independent networks that change constantly 
- How do I know where and how to get my informatino across the planet
- Where am I going? (IP Address) 
- What local roads should I take? 
	(Autonomous Systems)
- How do I know what roads connect to allow me to get closer to my destination?
	(Peering)

Where am I going? 

- Internet Protocol 
- Acts as an address on the Internet
- The Internet Protocol assembles data from the layers above it into a packet with an address header
- Like an envelope with an address on the outside 
- Please deliver this information to 8.8.8.8


What local roads should I take? 

- Autonomous System (AS)
- Grouping of IP addresses that make routing information between independent networks easier
- Might include large networks like AT&T, Sprint, or Verizon 
- Goal is to have organizations that manage thousands of IP addresses comminucate with one another
- Autonomous Systems use "Peering Relationships" 
- AS provide will broadcast a list of other independent networks it has a connection with 
- So even if your AS doesn't know where 8.8.8.8 is, perhaps one of its neighbors does 
- The information is forwarded to a neighbor that knows where to send that information 

Why does this matter?

- Vulnerabilities exist in several of these protocols 
- Hackers use those vulnerabilities to gain access or to achieve an effect
- Software developers who are not careful in the design of their software might introduce vectors of attack 
- Network administrators who leave vulnerabilities in their systems might introduce attack vectors 


Take Away

- Information that deals with routing is done at the network layer
- Locations on the Internet are established by Internet Protocol
- Autonomous Systems are large networks that manage thousands of Internet Protocol addresses 
- Autonomous Systems maintain peering relationships
