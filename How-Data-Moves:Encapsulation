How Data Actually Moves 

- The Internet allows for a broad set of independent network to communicate with one another 
- The World Wide Web represents a rich set of content, linked together, with an easy to access user interface 
- How does data move from one point of the earth to another?

The Concept of Encapsulation 

- The ability for devices to communicate with one another requires a variety of instructions 
- Some relate to the applications you are using, others to the routing instructions of where to send data, still others on the physical medium used to transmit 
- We bundle those instructions together using the concept encapsulation

OSI Model

- Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model 
- A way to think about the communications functions independent of the technology or structure 
- Multiple "layers"
- Layers from the "stack"

OSI Model: Instructions for Each Layer

DATA 		APPLIATION 		7
DATA 		PRESENTATION 	6
DATA 		SESSION 			5
TCP+UDP 	Transport			4
Packets 	Network 			3
Frames		Data Link			2
Bits		Physical 			1

Encapsulated Instructions Moved Around the World 

Encapsulation is Fundamental 

- Encapsulation includes data from the applications you are using 
- Instructions for the recipient's application as well as all of the infrastructure 
- The data, packets, frames, and bits fly around globally interconnected networks 
- Laptops, phones, critical infrastructure, cars, and other devices use the Internet to send and receive information

Cybersecurity 

- Hackers can leverage weaknesses at different layers in the stack to steal or disrupt 
- Understanding how data is packaged, routed, and trasmitted is fundamental to understanding the range of threats
- Complexity in technical systems and the human processes they support is at the heart of cybersecurity 

Take Away

- Information must be trasmitted from different points of the earth 
- Instructions for data to be packaged, routed, and transmitted is done through a process called encapsulation 
- The OSI Model is a conceptual approach for understanding the layers in the "stack"
- Potential weaknesses in each layer are exploited by hackers to steal informatinon or disrupt organizational sevices
