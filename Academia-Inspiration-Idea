Questions to Consider


1. How do you expand technology in terms of scale, performanace, nad higher order functionality?
2. How do we communicate and share ideas about the internet?
3. How do gorups of people from all over work together to develop this type of technology?
4. How do you convert theory into the underlying fabric of our modern society? 


Origins: A Vision of the Future 


1. A vision opn a set of interconnected computers transmitting large volumes of data
2. A new theory of breaking data up into "packets" that can be moved around 
3. A prototype network that connected a computer in MA and another in Cali over a telephone line 

- The late 9150s through the early 1960s we have a vision of modern digital netowrked communications
- Networked devices, packetized communciations, and a prototype wide area network 
- Why is this not the end of the story? 
- Once a future is envisioned you probably want to try to build a small model
- Building a model or a prototype requires money 

Where is the best place to find that? 

- Government 
- Private Sector 
- Different Insentives 

This section talks about the fundamental questions that could be answered in terms of how we could achieve the prototyping of a particular project. 
In the next part, we are going to talk about how we move from a good idea to the implementation of it, and the role in which the government plays. 

Government and Prototyping 

The Challenge: Building A Prototype

- Research at several academic instituitions contitues through the mid 60s. In 1966, Lawrence Roberts, moves to Defence Advanced Reserach Projects Agency (DARPA). He decides to fund in 1968, a project that becomes known as the ARPANET. This project has in essence a handful of nodes to demonstrate at a prototype level, a series of interconnected networks, and those nodes are at the universities of UCLA, Standford, UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah. hese nodes and here's a map of the early network topology of ARPANET in 1969. This project demonstrates that there is a real ability to move packet ties traffic or data from one part of the earth to the next, in this particular case. 

"Internetwork" Concept
