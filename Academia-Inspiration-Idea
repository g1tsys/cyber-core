Origins: A Vision of the Future 


1. A vision opn a set of interconnected computers transmitting large volumes of data
2. A new theory of breaking data up into "packets" that can be moved around 
3. A prototype network that connected a computer in MA and another in Cali over a telephone line 

- The late 9150s through the early 1960s we have a vision of modern digital netowrked communications
- Networked devices, packetized communciations, and a prototype wide area network 
- Why is this not the end of the story? 
- Once a future is envisioned you probably want to try to build a small model
- Building a model or a prototype requires money 

Where is the best place to find that? 

- Government 
- Private Sector 
- Different Insentives 

This section talks about the fundamental questions that could be answered in terms of how we could achieve the prototyping of a particular project. 
In the next part, we are going to talk about how we move from a good idea to the implementation of it, and the role in which the government plays.
