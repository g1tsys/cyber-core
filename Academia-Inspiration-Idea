Questions to Consider

1. How do you expand technology in terms of scale, performanace, and higher order functionality?
2. How do we communicate and share ideas about the internet?
3. How do groups of people from all over work together to develop this type of technology?
4. How do you convert theory into the underlying fabric of our modern society? 


Origins: A Vision of the Future 
1. A vision opn a set of interconnected computers transmitting large volumes of data
2. A new theory of breaking data up into "packets" that can be moved around 
3. A prototype network that connected a computer in MA and another in Cali over a telephone line 

- The late 9150s through the early 1960s we have a vision of modern digital netowrked communications
- Networked devices, packetized communciations, and a prototype wide area network 
- Why is this not the end of the story? 
- Once a future is envisioned you probably want to try to build a small model
- Building a model or a prototype requires money 

Where is the best place to find that? 

- Government 
- Private Sector 
- Different Incentives 

This section talks about the fundamental questions that could be answered in terms of how we could achieve the prototyping of a particular project. 
In the next part, we are going to talk about how we move from a good idea to the implementation of it, and the role in which the government plays. 

Government and Prototyping 

The Challenge: Building A Prototype

- Research at several academic instituitions contitues through the mid 60s. In 1966, Lawrence Roberts, moves to Defence Advanced Reserach Projects Agency (DARPA). He decides to fund in 1968, a project that becomes known as the ARPANET. This project has in essence a handful of nodes to demonstrate at a prototype level, a series of interconnected networks, and those nodes are at the universities of UCLA, Standford, UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah. hese nodes and here's a map of the early network topology of ARPANET in 1969. This project demonstrates that there is a real ability to move packet ties traffic or data from one part of the earth to the next, in this particular case. 

"Internetwork" Concept 

- The internet was absed on the idea that computers could talk to one another by interlinking multiple independent networks together.
- ARPANET started as the first packet switchin network. Key protocols are developed during this period of time including 
		- internet protocol (location)
		- Transmission Control Protocol 
- These protocols still exist in the internet currently 

Rules of the "Internetwork" 

1. Each distinct network would have to stand on its own
2. Communications would be on a best effort basis. if a packet did not make it, it would be restransmitted. 
3. "Black boxes" would be used to connect the networks.
4. There would be no global control at the operations level 


Vision of a Limited Set of Networks 

- By the late 1960s, it was assumed only a handful of networks would exist. 
- The thought was that only a small number of networks would be connected together ARPANET. 
- Assumption was that 256 networks would be enough! 


A Few Good Applications 

- Only a few applications were available to use in this set of interconnected devices. 
- To transfer fiels we created the "File Transfer Protocol" (FTP)
- To allow for remote login we created TELNET.
- To send messages we developed e-mail. 

New Challenge: Scaling 

Government provided the funding to build that small network to develop a "bench scale" prototype.

Private Sector Support and Moving The Internet Out of the Lab 

It works, but now what? 

- By 1969, ARPANET demonstrated that a distributed and digitized network was feasible 
- Academic vision was supported through government sponsorship to prove out a radiacl new way of commucating 
- The original vision allowed for only 256 addresses on this "internetwork" 

How did the story of Internetwork become more popular? Expanding Popularity of Networks 
- With teh success of ARPANET and the progression of new protocols, new often ad hoc netowrks are developed (which means they are built with their own set of instructions and own set of technologies in some cases) 
- By the earlyl 1970s, a new standardized method for networing is invented. 
- "Ethernet" is developed at the Xerox Coporation (one of the fundational technology that's still used today) 

Combing Technologies 
- Standardized networking technologies are developed 
- Moving computer terminals into business environments 
- Early developedment of perosnal computers towards the end of the 1970s (Apple I) 

Explosion of Networks and Computers 

- A way to convert Internet Protocol Addresses (e.g. 8.8.8.8) into human friendly names (e.g. Google)
- We needed a set of instructions that could allow the translation between arcane addresses like .8 to be turned into names like google that gives rise to the emergence of DNS or Domain Name System. 
- A need to route between devices and networks, so "routers" are developed. 

Scaling Technologies Enables Communications 

- New scaling technologies enable new communities of interest to develop. 
- Networks are built around specific purposes
- Department of Energy and NASA 
- By the early 1980s the military begins using the technology more widely 

Community Ownership 

- Public availability of the documents specifying the protocols
- Leads to accelerating growth and adoption of new technologies 
- Created a positive feedback loop leading to growth in quality and the number of standards 
- Today there are dozens of working groups focused on a range of internet enabled technologies 


Take Away 

- Private sector development of scaling technologies help drive growth 
- Communitiy development of standards accelerates adoption 
- By the early 1980s, multiple puerpose drive networks are connected together
- Next section, it's going to be about the transition of the projects from DARPA funded to privately owned. 

How do we manage this thing? 

- By the early 1980s, "internetworking" has become more popular
- Several purpose-built networks now exist 
- A variety of protocols are utilitzed to commincate creating challenges for broad adoption 
- ARPANET at the heart of the interconnection between these networks 

The Birth of The Internet
- By 1983, ARPAMNET is still the central "connective tissue" between all the individual networks. 
- The goal is now to allow networks to independently communicate with one another
- Previous work on Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is adopted universwally in 1984.
- This is the birth of the modern "Internet" 

Incentives to Scale the Internet 

- Moving the US government out of a central networking position in 1983 is couple with incentivizing the private sector 
- National Science Foundation (NSF) builds high speed connections between research groups, but prohibits private sector use. 
- Encourages private companies to seek customers for new services 
- Leads to investment and construction of private sector long haul comminucations (1st Internet Boom) 

Governmen Research Support 

- Supercomputer Network Study Act of 1986
- Act Allocated $600 million for high performance computing 
- Accelerate the development and deplotment of high-speed networking 
- National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois where a team of programmers, including Netscape founder Marc Andreessen created the Moaic web browser. 

Take Away

- Adoption of TCP/IP as the internetworking standard marks the birth of the modern internet. 
- Incentives for the private sector to build its own networks helps expand capacity of the Internet. 
- Governement support of high-speed networking and advanced research set us up for the next big revolution, the world wide web.
